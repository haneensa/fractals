<p>Fractals are never ending  patterns that are self-similar across different scales.
They are created by repeating a simple process over and over again. </p>

<h3><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>Cantor Set</h3>
<p>Cantor set is a fractal in which it's constucted by repeatedly removing some percentage of a line segment.
The most popular variant is Cantor Ternary set, where the middle thirds of a line segment is removed.
One of the interesting properties of the Cantor set is that, it can be proven that 
the length of the segments removed all add up to the length of the original segment,
yet there are still as many points remaining!

with another equilateral triangle at the location it was removed.</p>
